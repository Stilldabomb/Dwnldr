# Dwnldr
$0.99 tweak on the BigBoss repository, I've open sourced it for people to learn and if they cannot afford it they can build their own copy.

## Building
In Terminal, in the project directory run
`./dwnldr_build_deb.sh`

## Installing
Open `Dwnldr.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press `âŒ˜+B` and it will install it to your device if you have [ssh over usb](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/SSH_Over_USB) enabled.
